title: Welcome to My Fantasy NHL Optimizer
---

I attended Wharton's Moneyball academy in the summer following my junior year, or July 2025. This is where I first learned to code in R and how to apply math and statistics concepts to real data. After the program ended, I kept exploring through an online data analytics course and eventually branched out to a finance course. Reading, practicing, and taking quizzes online expanded my skillset, but I know the best way to keep developing is to apply what I'm learning. So, I'm coming back to apply my new skills to what I know best—hockey.

This project isn't strictly about hockey. I've grown to love hockey not just for the game played on the ice, but for the data and similarities to other fields that it offers, specifically finance. This project is about optimizing a roster similar to how traders optimize portfolios, treating players as investments that can result in great profits or losses. I'm really just starting my first personal project in a way that is beginner-friendly and fun for me.

This blog documents my journey as I develop a tool to optimize fantasy points based on league requirements and available players. Whether you're a hockey fan looking for deeper insights, an explorer of finance interested in a different application of financial concepts, or someone seeking an edge in your fantasy league, I'll be sharing my progress, findings, and discoveries as I work to understand what truly drives success in both fantasy and optimization, and how to translate that into success with my tool. I’m still learning both the technical skills and how to really think like a developer, but that’s exactly why I’m building this publicly. It will keep me accountable, help track my progress, and share what I discover along the way.

This optimizer is, in a way, my starting point in a new interest in my life—a way to bridge data analytics and financial thinking through something I know extremely well. Join me as I explore what happens when hockey meets algorithmic optimization.

Each week's code can be found at the bottom of that corresponding week's post, with a link to a separate page.
