title: Welcome to My Fantasy NHL Optimizer
---
I'm Henry Lange, and hockey has been my passion for 13 years. As a former goalie for Team Illinois and the U18 West Dundee Leafs, I've experienced the game from the crease to the bench. Now I'm channeling that on-ice knowledge into NHL analytics and fantasy optimization.

This blog follows my journey as I develop new approaches to hockey analysis and fantasy strategy. Whether you're a hockey fan looking for deeper insights or someone seeking an edge in your fantasy league, I'll be sharing my progress, findings, and discoveries as I work to understand what truly drives success on the ice.

I'm combining years of playing experience with data analysis to uncover patterns that can improve both your hockey knowledge and your fantasy results. Join me as I explore the intersection of hockey instinct and analytical precision.
