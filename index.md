# About Me
I'm Henry Lange, and hockey has shaped my life for over 13 years. As a former goalie for Team Illinois and the U18 West Dundee Leafs, I've experienced much of what this complex sport has to offer. This past summer majorly changed my athletic and academic trajectory, and I'm now channeling my on-ice knowledge into NHL analytics and fantasy optimization. 

That change began at Wharton's Moneyball academy in July 2025, where I first learned to code in R and how to apply math and statistics concepts to real data. After the program ended, I kept exploring through an online data analytics course and a finance course. Reading, practicing, and taking quizzes online expanded my skillset, but I know the best way to keep developing is to apply what I'm learning. So, I'm coming back to what I know best—hockey. 

I've grown to love hockey not just for the game itself, but also for the data and similarities to other fields that it offers. Fields that I hope to delve into further soon, like finance for example. Hockey is offering me a perfpect place to begin exploration on a new, deep interest in my life. This isn't about hockey in particular. It's about optimizing a roster similar to how traders optimize portfolios, treating players as investments that can result in great profits or losses. 

This blog documents my journey as I develop a tool to optimize fantasy points based on league requirements and available players. Whether you're a hockey fan looking for deeper insights, an explorer of finance interested in a different application of financial concepts, or someone seeking an edge in your fantasy league, I'll be sharing my progress, findings, and discoveries as I work to understand what truly drives success in both fantasy and optimization, and how to translate that into success with my tool. I’m still learning both the technical skills and how to really think like a developer. But that’s exactly why I’m building this publicly: it will keep me accountable, help track my progress, and share what I discover along the way. 

This optimizer is my starting point—a way to bridge data analytics and financial thinking through something I know deeply. Join me as I explore what happens when hockey meets algorithmic optimization.
