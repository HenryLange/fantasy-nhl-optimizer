title: "Week 2: Implementing a Scoring System and Setting Up Optimization"
date: 2025-09-14

Last Sunday, I focused on cleaning up the data and exploring what stats were available for both skaters and goalies. Then, this week, I made a bunch of visuals to explore that data. Now it’s time to actually **translate hockey stats into fantasy hockey points.** This is the first big step towards building an optimizer, because without a scoring system, we can’t compare players and make decisions on which player is better than another when It comes to maximizing points.

---

### Step 1: Creating a Fantasy Scoring System
I created a new column for both the goalie and player datasets that weighted stats differently to find each player’s total fantasy points for that season. For my scoring system in this week’s code, I used a point system found on fantasydata.com. The exact scoring system can (and will) change depending on the fantasy league format, but the important thing is that every key stat a player records now converts into a single number, that being **fantasy points.**

Here is what I did to create the point system.
```r
#I am using point values from fantasydata.com, and I will make a new column to calculate what every players fantasy points would be for this season

player_stats_2425 <- player_stats_2425 %>%
  mutate(fantasy_points = (3 * G) +
      (2 * A) +
      (1 * plusMinus) +
      (0.5 * SOG) +
      (0.5 * BLK) +
      (0.5 * powerPlayGoals) +
      (0.5 * powerPlayAssists) +
      (0.5 * shortHandedGoals) +
      (0.5 * shorthandedAssists)
  )

# same thing but now for goalies and their scoring system

goalie_stats_2425 <- goalie_stats_2425 %>% 
  mutate(fantasy_points = (3 * W) +
      (-1 * GA) + 
      (0.2 * saves) +
      (2 * shutouts)
  )
```
As seen, for players, goals are worth 3 points, regular assists are worth 2 points, and various other things like shots and blocks are worth 0.5 points. For goalies, a win is worth 3 points, saves are all worth 0.2 points, and goalies can lose a point by letting up a goal.

This scoring system is what transforms raw data into something usable for optimization.

### Step 2: Master Tables
Once every player had fantasy points assigned, I created **master tables** for both skaters and goalies. These tables simply hold the player’s name, position (for the skater table), and their total fantasy points.  

To get a sense of who the top players were under this point system, I sorted both tables by fantasy points (with the greatest points at the top, and least at the bottom) and looked at the **top 20 skaters and goalies.**

### Step 3: Fantasy Points by Position
When I finished this process, I was also curious about whether certain skater positions generally got more fantasy points than others. Are centers scoring way more fantasy points than defensemen? Do wingers dominate? I wanted to visualize the data to get an answer.

Here’s a quick visualization showing **fantasy points by position** across all skaters:  

![Fantasy Points by Position]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/fantast_points_by_position.png)

These plots and the visual as a whole actually look pretty close to the points by position that I visualized in my last post. This makes sense because points are made up by goals and assists, two things that contribute pretty heavily to fantasy points. The positions LW, RW, C, and D all have pretty similar distributions, and there’s no one outlier in these. Just like in the visual I previously mentioned, the position W seems to do exceptionally well, while F does worse than any others. I’m unsure what makes a player F or W, but if this becomes important in the process later, then I will look into it closely.

### What’s next?
This week’s work wasn’t about “picking the best team” yet, but it was **the foundation of optimization.** Now, every player has a single number that reflects their fantasy value, and we can compare players across positions.  

You can see my code for this week in the [code](https://henrylange.github.io/fantasy-nhl-optimizer/code/) section.

Next week, I’ll start tackling **basic optimization with roster rules**, actually trying to assemble a team that maximizes total points within constraints. That’s when I will truly be optimizing.
