title: "Project Plan & Structure"
date: 2025-09-01

In this post, I am outlining the plan and structure for my NHL fantasy opimizer. I am aiming to keep the workflow organized for coding, analysis, and weekly blog updates as I develop the project. Whether my week is a complete failure or a major success, I will report what I learn and gain from each step.

### Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:  
- Build a Fantasy NHL team optimizer tool using only R.  
- Explore player stats and projections to inform decisions.  
- Apply optimization and simulation techniques to select the best fantasy lineups.  
- Document progress and reflections on the blog each week (weekly posts every Sunday).

### Project Structure

All of my work will appear on this blog. The main page includes a brief introduction into who I am and what I am doing, and below, my posts will be listed chronologically. As I go through the process of this, I will share code, visuals, and other findings from my time on R, in my posts. However, the **final product of my project will be on the home/navigation page of this site,** right under my introduction to myself and this project.

My posts will show progress and findings, while the code folder will only contain my final code once I am complete. 

If I need to create more folders, I will do so as I progress. Each folder will have a specific purpose and title to keep the project organized and easy to navigate.

### Weekly Plan / Milestones

Here’s the roadmap I plan to follow:

1. **Week 1:** Set Up Project and Load Initial Data  
2. **Week 1.5:** Explore the NHL Dataset and Summarize Data (hope to have fun with some visuals here) 
3. **Week 2:** Implement Scoring System and Basic Optimizer  
4. **Week 3:** Add Filters, Projections, and Improved Tables  
5. **Week 4:** Restrictions and Draft Simulations  
6. **Week 5:** Advanced Drafts and Custom Score Weighting  
7. **Week 6:** Tool Creation and Exploring What's Next

### Code / Tools

The project will use R and several key libraries within it:  
- `tidyverse` for data manipulation (tidyverse is just unmatched) 
- `ggplot2` for visualizations  
- `lpSolve` for optimization  
- RMarkdown for documenting analysis and generating outputs

### What's next?

In the following week, I will dive into loading and exploring the NHL dataset, summarizing key stats, and preparing it for the optimizer. I will spend time looking for a great dataset, and I want to become familiar with that dataset so the optimization works how I intend it to. Taking the time to go through the dataset and learn more about it before I make this tool will all be tracked and documented in my next post on Sunday.
