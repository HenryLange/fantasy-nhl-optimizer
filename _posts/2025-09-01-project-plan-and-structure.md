title: "Project Plan & Structure"

In  this post I am outlining the plan and structure for my NHL fantasy opimizer. I am aiming to keep the workflow organized for coding, analysis, and weekly blog updates as I develop the project. Whether my week is a complete failure or major success, I will report what I learn and gain from each step.

### Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:  
- Build a Fantasy NHL team optimizer tool using only R.  
- Explore player stats and projections to inform decisions.  
- Apply optimization and simulation techniques to select the best fantasy lineups.  
- Document progress and reflections on the blog each week (weekly posts every sunday).

### Project Structure

All of my work will appear on this blog. The main page includes a brief introdution into who I am and what I am doing, and below my posts will be listed chronologically. As I go through the process of this, I will share code, visuals, and other findings from my time on R in my posts. However, the final product of my project will be on the "Code" page in the navigation bar.

My posts will show progress and findings, while the code code folder will only contain my final code once I am complete. 

If I need to create more folders I will do so as I progress. Each folder will have a specific purpose and title to keep the project organized and easy to navigate

### Weekly Plan / Milestones

Hereâ€™s the roadmap I plan to follow:

1. **Week 1:** Set up project, load initial data  
2. **Week 1.5:** Explore the NHL dataset and summarize stats (hope to have fun with some visuals here) 
3. **Week 2:** Implement scoring system and basic optimizer  
4. **Week 3:** Add filters, projections, and improved tables  
5. **Week 4:** Draft simulations and advanced scoring features  
6. **Week 5:** Refine code, clean functions, and outputs  
7. **Week 6:** Wrap-up, final reflections, and blog summary

### Code / Tools

The project will use R and several key libraries within it:  
- `tidyverse` for data manipulation (tidyverse is just unmatched) 
- `ggplot2` for visualizations  
- `lpSolve` (or similar) for optimization  
- RMarkdown for documenting analysis and generating outputs

### What's next?

in the following week I will dive into loading and exploring the NHL dataset, summarizing key stats, and preparing it for the optimizer. I will spend time looking for a great dataset, and I want to become familiar with that dataset so the optimization works how I intend it to. Taking the time to go through the dataset and learn more about it before I make this tool will all be tracked and documented in my next post on Sunday.
