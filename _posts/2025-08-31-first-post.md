I’ve had the idea for this project since mid-July, when I spent three weeks at Wharton’s Moneyball Sports Analytics program. I was paired with three baseball fans for our group project, so obviously we didn’t work on a hockey project.  

When I got back home to Illinois, I tried to figure out the best way to start a project like this. Connecting a repository to RStudio took hours and never worked, so I put the project aside for a bit. Now I’m hoping this setup works, and I can finally dive in.

The goal of this project is to apply some of the things I learned at wharton to Hockey, a sport I love and didn't get touched on much at Wharton. Hopefully I create a tool that develops my coding skills, stats and optimiation skills, and most importantly insures I have a great year in my fantasy league so I can choose my friend's punishment.
