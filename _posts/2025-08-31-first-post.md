title: "Starting My Fantasy NHL Optimizer"

I’ve had the idea to analyze hockey since mid-July, during the Wharton Moneyball Sports Analytics program I previously mentioned. However, I was paired with three baseball fans for our group project, so obviously, we didn’t work on a hockey project.  

When I got back home to Illinois, I tried to figure out the best way to start a project like this. Connecting a Github repository to RStudio took hours and never worked, so I put the project aside for a bit. Now I’m hoping this setup works, and I can finally dive in. In a way I'm glad I didn't start right away, though, because now I am equipt with a much better toolset from the online courses I continue to learn from

The goal of this project is to apply some of the things I learned at Wharton and my classes following the program to Hockey, almost in a financially minded way. And again, we barely touched on it at the program, so I have to give hockey it's chance to shine. Hopefully, I will create a tool that develops my coding, stats, and optimization skills, and most importantly, ensures I have a great year in my fantasy league so I can choose my one of my friend's punishment.
