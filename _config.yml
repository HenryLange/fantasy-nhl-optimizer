title: Fantasy NHL Optimizer
description: "Hi! I’m Henry Lange, a 17-year-old senior at Barrington High School in Illinois. Hockey has shaped my life since I was just four years old. I worked my way up to being a goalie for Team Illinois, and last year I played up an age level with the U18 West Dundee Leafs, the #1 ranked AA team in the country. After spending my summer diving into sports data analysis, I realized something: the competition I loved on the ice, like reading complex patterns and making split-second decisions under pressure, translates perfectly to quantitative finance. As I did more research into this field, seeing the intersection between math, algorithms, and trading drew me in even more. Now, I am trying to develop skills that will take my competitive nature from the ice to financial markets."
